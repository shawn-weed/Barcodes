A python program to create and print labels with a qrcode and a serial number for chargers that correspond with the device serial number. The program uses a master list of serial numbers loaded into a pandas dataframe. That df is then joined to another dataframe loaded from a csv of homerooms to seperate by class so administrators could apply labels in an efficient way for our 4700+ devices.
